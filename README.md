# node-mcc-website
A quick three-day project inspired by https://malaysianclubchicago.com/ in an attempt to make it better.
The website was created with pure Node.js as its backend, and Handlebars, CSS, and JS for the frontend.
All images, videos, and other external sources are from the prior MCC website or Unsplash.
